# SDE-Prep

A curated study repository for software-engineer interview preparation covering Java, OOP & design, DSA, concurrency, system design, backend architecture, and supporting resources.

## Repository Structure

- `01-java-core/`: Core Java topics with `examples/`, `notes/`, and `pitfalls/`.
- `02-oops-design/`: OOP concepts, design principles, patterns, and case studies.
- `03-dsa/`: Data structures & algorithms organized by topic:
	- `01-arrays/`, `02-strings/`, `03-linked-list/`, `04-stack-queue/`, `05-trees/`, `06-graphs/`, `07-dp/`, `08-greedy/`, `09-backtracking/`, `10-bit-manipulation/`
- `04-concurrency/`: Concurrency basics, executors, Java Memory Model (`jmm/`), synchronization and problems.
- `05-lld/`: Low-level design — patterns, interview questions, machine-coding and principles.
- `06-hld/`: High-level design components, fundamentals, system designs and tradeoffs.
- `07-databases/`: SQL, NoSQL, indexing and transactions.
- `08-backend-architecture/`: Caching, consistency, messaging, REST and scalability patterns.
- `09-devops-basics/`: CI/CD, deployment and Docker notes.
- `10-interview-revision/`: Quick reference materials and cheatsheets (e.g., `dsa-patterns.md`, `java-cheatsheet.md`).
- `resources/`: Curated external links: blogs, books and videos.

## How to Use

- Browse folders by topic and follow the suggested order in `03-dsa/` for algorithm practice.
- Each topic folder typically contains notes, examples, and common pitfalls — start with `notes/` then `examples/`.
- To add content: create a branch, add files in the appropriate folder, include a short README or notes file, and open a pull request describing changes.

## Conventions

- Use clear, descriptive file and folder names.
- Prefer small, focused commits and include references to problems or resources added.
